(ns eth-crypto.test-cljs-primitives
  "cljs-only verification of the two primitives the ClojureScript port had to
  implement from scratch, at their own level rather than only through the
  end-to-end signing vectors.

  SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA256 exist here because RFC 6979's nonce derivation needs
  them and `javax.crypto` has no cljs equivalent (and the browser's SubtleCrypto
  is async). Their 64 round constants are transcribed, which is the error-prone
  part — so the canonical digests of \"\", \"abc\" and the 448-bit NIST message are
  asserted, plus a published HMAC vector. A single wrong constant changes the
  output completely, so these are sufficient.

  Keccak-256 is asserted here on a MULTI-BLOCK input (200 bytes > the 136-byte
  rate), which the shared suite's short vectors do not exercise — the absorb loop
  and the pad-to-rate arithmetic only get tested when the message spans more than
  one permutation. The expected value is viem's."
